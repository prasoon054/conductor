# Complete this script to deploy external-service and counter-service in two separate containers
# You will be using the conductor tool that you completed in task 3.

# Creating link to the tool within this directory
ln -s ../task3/conductor.sh conductor.sh
ln -s ../task3/setup.sh setup.sh

# use the above scripts to accomplish the following actions -

# Logical actions to do:
# 1. Build images for the containers
echo "Building counter-service image..."
sudo ./conductor.sh build cs-image csfile

echo "Building external-service image..."
sudo ./conductor.sh build es-image esfile
# 2. Run two containers say es-cont and cs-cont which should run in background. Tip: to keep the container running
#    in background you should use a init program that will not interact with the terminal and will not
#    exit. e.g. sleep infinity, tail -f /dev/null




# 3. Configure network such that:
#    3.a: es-cont is connected to the internet and es-cont has its port 8080 forwarded to port 3000 of the host


#    3.b: cs-cont is connected to the internet and does not have any port exposed


#    3.c: peer network is setup between es-cont and cs-cont


# 5. Get ip address of cs-cont. You should use script to get the ip address. 
#    You can use ip interface configuration within the host to get ip address of cs-cont or you can 
#    exec any command within cs-cont to get it's ip address



# 6. Within cs-cont launch the counter service using exec [path to counter-service directory within cs-cont]/run.sh


# 7. Within es-cont launch the external service using exec [path to external-service directory within es-cont]/run.sh


# 8. Within your host system open/curl the url: http://localhost:3000 to verify output of the service
# 9. On any system which can ping the host system open/curl the url: `http://<host-ip>:3000` to verify
#    output of the service
